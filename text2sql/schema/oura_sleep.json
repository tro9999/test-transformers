  "desciption": "This sleep summary data provides insights into your sleep quality for a specific night. It includes details such as the date of the sleep period, total sleep duration, sleep efficiency percentage, sleep score representing overall sleep quality, and the distribution of different sleep stages (REM, light, and deep sleep). You can use this information to assess how well you slept, the amount of restful sleep obtained, and any potential sleep disturbances. Additionally, metrics like heart rate, restlessness, and temperature deviation offer further context. With these details, you can evaluate your sleep patterns and make adjustments to improve your overall sleep health.",
